**Overview of the Project**< br / > 

**Introduction**< br / > 
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The goal is to understand the dataset's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers and visualize these insights to derive meaningful conclusions.< br / > (

**Dataset**< br / > 
The Zomato dataset contains information about various restaurants listed on Zomato, including ratings, cuisines, cost, and more. Additionally, a Country Code mapping dataset is used to enrich the Zomato dataset with country names.< br / >

**Objectives**< br / >
Understand the distribution and characteristics of the Zomato dataset.
Identify trends and patterns in restaurant ratings, country-wise usage, and online delivery options.
Visualize data to uncover insights and make data-driven decisions.< br / >

**Key Activities**< br / >
Data Loading: Import datasets into pandas DataFrames.< br / >
Initial Data Exploration: Examine the first few rows, columns, and general information about the dataset.< br / >
Data Merging: Enrich the Zomato dataset with country names using a Country Code mapping file.< br / >
Data Analysis: Perform various analyses, including country-wise usage, rating distributions, and online delivery options.< br / >
Data Visualization: Create visualizations such as pie charts, bar plots, and heatmaps to illustrate key findings.< br / >


**Technologies Used**< br / >
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.< br / >
Numpy: For numerical operations.< br / >
Matplotlib: For data visualization.< br / >
Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization.< br / >
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive code execution and visualization.< br / >

**Datasets**< br / >
zomato.csv: The main dataset containing restaurant details.< br / >
Country-Code.xlsx: A mapping file for country codes to country names.< br / >

**Visualizations**< br / >
Pie charts for country-wise and city-wise distributions.< br / >
Bar plots for rating distributions.< br / >
Heatmaps for missing values visualization.< br / >

This project serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding and analyzing similar datasets, providing a framework for performing EDA and deriving meaningful insights from data.
